# EduCombat - A educational mini game

> This is a combat-quiz-minigame that I made for my Game Development course.

> The theme was Energy and the difference of its types.
> The game consists in concluding correctly a quiz and, to do so, you`ll need to battle different enemies to gather information about different types of energy.
